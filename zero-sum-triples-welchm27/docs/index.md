In this problem, you must implement a method that finds all distinct triples of values in an `int[]` that sum to 0. For example, in the array `{1, -2, 2, 5, 3, 0, -4, -1}`, there are 5 such distinct triples:

* `[-4, -1, 5]`
* `[-4, 1, 3]`
* `[-2, -1, 3]`
* `[-2, 0, 2]`
* `[-1, 0, 1]`

In addition to the required functionality, you are encouraged to implement---as a stretch goal---an approach with time complexity of $O \left( n^2 \right)$.
